            <h2>MERN Project</h2>
            <br />
            <h4>What is MERN?</h4>
            <br />
            <p>
              MERN stack is the combination of MongoDB, Express, React, and
              Node.js.
            </p>
            <br />
            <h4>MongoDB</h4>
            <br />
            <p>
              MongoDB is a very popular database used in the MERN stack. In
              simple words, it is a database which facilitates online storage.
              It is a NoSQL document-oriented database, with flexible schema and
              JSON-based query language.
            </p>
            <br />
            <h4>Express</h4>
            <br />
            <p>
              Express is the framework that simplifies the task of writing your
              server code. The Express framework allows you to define routes,
              specifications on what to do when an HTTP request matching a
              certain pattern arrives.
            </p>
            <br />
            <h4>React</h4>
            <br />
            <p>
              React anchors the MERN stack. In a sense, this is the defining
              component of the MERN stack. React is an open-source JavaScript
              library maintained by Facebook that can be used to create views
              rendered in HTML.
            </p>
            <br />
            <h4>Node.js</h4>
            <br />
            <p>
              Node.js is JavaScript outside of a browser. The creators of
              Node.js just used Chromeâ€™s V8 JavaScript engine and made it work
              independently as a JavaScript runtime engine. If you are familiar
              with the Java runtime that runs Java programs, you can easily
              associate with the JavaScript runtime: the Node.js runtime runs
              JavaScript programs.
