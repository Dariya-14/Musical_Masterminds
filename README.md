# Musical_Masterminds
Musical Masterminds is a student built project app which allows a user to Sign in & out, Create an account, and Delete an account. The purpose of the app is to take part in a musical theatre themed quiz with questions and answers imported using an API via https://opentdb.com

The user can select the difficulty of the questions, ranging from Easy / Medium / Hard, to suit their preferences and test their knowledge. The user can also input how many questions they would like to answer.

This project was built by Josh, Maddy, and Joe. Students who are partaking in the CodeNation Master: Coding course, an intense online bootcamp, designed for an in-depth look at full-stackdevelopment. For more information on CodeNation, please visit https://wearecodenation.com/

To build this App we used the MERN stack. MERN stack is the combination of MongoDB, Express, React, and Node.js. 
We also used Axios to connect the front + backend together through express.

# Connection String

- For securtiy reasons we used our own mongo Atlas string which is stored in a .env file.
